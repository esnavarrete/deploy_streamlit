# Simple webapp using Netflix data

Created for Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey's Senior Data Scientist diploma course.

This simple webapp was created using Streamlit and a Firestore database. The dataset has information about Netflix movies.
The webapp has very simple features, intended to practice development with Streamlit: filtering data, sidebars, forms, etc.

Access to the Firestore database is open until April 22nd, 2024.
